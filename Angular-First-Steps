change the application title

You can find them in the YOURprojectName/src/app folder.

You'll find the implementation of the shell AppComponent distributed over three files:

    app.component.ts— the component class code, written in TypeScript.
    app.component.html— the component template, written in HTML.
    app.component.css— the component's private CSS styles.
